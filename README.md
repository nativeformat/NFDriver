## Architecture :triangular_ruler:
`NFDriver` is designed as a common C++ interface to write information to different systems sound drivers in a low latency. The API simply allows you to create a driver that will then call the callbacks fed into it every time a new block of audio data is requested. It uses very basic C functions in order to reduce the amount of latency when interfacing to it, and to prevent unwanted locks in some implementations of the C++ 11 STL. It always has a fixed block size of 1024 samples it will ask for at any one time.

It also has the ability to report errors, stutters, and give callbacks before and after the rendering of a block.

You may notice it has a fixed samplerate and number of channels. This was done due to this being the standard configuration in music output, so in order to lower the complexity of the API and the way each wrapper acts with the system we decided to hardcode these values.

Our support table looks like so:

| OS            | Underlying Framework                                                                                         | Status  |

## Installation :inbox_tray:
`NFDriver` is a cmake project, while you can feel free to download the prebuilt static libraries it is recommended to use cmake to install this project into your wider project. In order to add this into a wider Cmake project, simply add the following line to your `CMakeLists.txt` file:
```
add_subdirectory(NFDriver)
```

### For iOS/OSX
Generate an Xcode project from the Cmake project like so:

```shell
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake .. -GXcode
```

### For Linux
Generate a Ninja project from the Cmake project like so:

```shell
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake .. -GNinja
```

### For Android
Use gradle to include the NFDriver project like so:

```
android {
    compileSdkVersion 26
    defaultConfig {
        applicationId "com.spotify.nfdrivertest_android"
        minSdkVersion 19
        targetSdkVersion 26
        versionCode 1
        versionName "1.0"
        externalNativeBuild {
            cmake {
                cppFlags ""
                arguments "-DANDROID_APP=1 -DANDROID=1"
            }
        }
    }

    sourceSets {
        main {
            jniLibs.srcDirs = ['src/main/cpp']
        }
    }

    externalNativeBuild {
        cmake {
            path "../CMakeLists.txt"
        }
    }
}
```

### For Windows
Generate a Visual Studio project from the Cmake project like so:

```shell
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 12 2013 Win64"
```

## Usage example :eyes:
For examples of this in use, see the demo program `src/cli/NFDriverCLI.cpp`. The API is rather small, it basically has a create function, and a stop/start interface on the created class. You feed the create function with the necessary callbacks used for inputting audio data and then press play.

```C++
NF_STUTTER_CALLBACK stutter_callback = [](void *clientdata) {
  printf("Driver Stuttered...\n");
};

NF_RENDER_CALLBACK render_callback = [](void *clientdata, float *frames, int numberOfFrames) {
  const float samplerate = 2000.0f;
  const float multiplier = (2.0f * float(M_PI) * samplerate) / float(NF_DRIVER_SAMPLERATE);
  static unsigned int sinewave = 0;
  for (int n = 0; n < numberOfFrames; n++) {
    float audio = sinf(multiplier * sinewave++);
    for (int i = 0; i < NF_DRIVER_CHANNELS; ++i) {
      *frames++ = audio;
    }
  }
  return numberOfFrames;

};
NF_ERROR_CALLBACK error_callback = [](void *clientdata, const char *errorMessage, int errorCode) {
  printf("Driver Error (%d): %s\n", errorCode, errorMessage);
};

NF_WILL_RENDER_CALLBACK will_render_callback = [](void *clientdata) {};

NF_DID_RENDER_CALLBACK did_render_callback = [](void *clientdata) {};

NFDriver *driver = nativeformat::driver::createDriver(nullptr /* Anything client specific to use in the callbacks */,
                                                      stutter_callback /* called on stutter */,
                                                      render_callback /* called when we have samples to output */,
                                                      error_callback /* called upon driver error */,
                                                      will_render_callback /* Called before render_callback */,
                                                      did_render_callback /* Called after render callback */,
                                                      nativeformat::driver::OutputTypeSoundCard);
driver->setPlaying(true);
```

The above will output a sine wave at 2kHz on the audio card.
